## Introduction

**Why youâ€™ll love it**:
> - **Simplify Multiple PHP Version Testing** with a single command
> - **Simple Version Switching** with a single value in your `.env`
> - **Full Docker Support** with a simple docker-compose file.
> - **PHP Debugging** with all supported PHP versions.
> - **Pull it in with Composer** and run the installation script.
